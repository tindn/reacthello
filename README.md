# Reacthello

Welcome to Reacthello, a web app built in React for the [Othello/Reversi](http://www.othelloonline.org/){:target="\_blank"} game.

To start playing:

* Clone the source code
* If you have yarn, do the following

  ```bash
  cd reacthello
  yarn install
  yarn start
  ```

* If you prefer npm

  ```bash
  cd reacthello
  npm install
  npm start
  ```

This game is built as a code challenge with time limit. Therefore it's quite
rough around the edges.
